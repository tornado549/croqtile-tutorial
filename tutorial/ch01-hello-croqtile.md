# Hello Croqtile: From Zero to Running Kernel

You are about to write, compile, and run a complete Croqtile program — an element-wise addition of two small matrices. It deliberately does nothing clever: no tiling, no DMA, no fancy thread hierarchy. All of that comes later. Right now the only goal is to see the moving parts of a Croqtile program and how they connect.

## The Two Parts of a Croqtile Program

Every Croqtile program has exactly two parts:

1. **Croqtile Function** (`__co__`) — the kernel logic, marked with the `__co__` prefix. It describes computation on shaped tensors. The compiler transpiles this into GPU-ready code.
2. **Host Program** — standard C++ that prepares data, calls the Croqtile function, and checks results.

Both parts live in a single `.co` file. The compiler tells them apart by the `__co__` prefix.

## A Complete Example: Element-Wise Addition

Here is the full program. It adds two `[4, 8]` matrices of 32-bit integers element by element:

```choreo
__co__ s32 [4, 8] ele_add(s32 [4, 8] lhs, s32 [4, 8] rhs) {
  s32 [lhs.span] output;

  parallel {i, j} by [4, 8]
    output.at(i, j) = lhs.at(i, j) + rhs.at(i, j);

  return output;
}

int main() {
  auto lhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(4, 8);
  auto rhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(4, 8);
  lhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = ele_add(lhs.view(), rhs.view());

  for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < 8; ++j)
      choreo::choreo_assert(lhs[i][j] + rhs[i][j] == res[i][j],
                          "values are not equal.");

  std::cout << "Test Passed\n" << std::endl;
}
```

Save this as `ele_add.co`, compile, and run:

```bash
croqtile ele_add.co -o ele_add
./ele_add
```

You should see `Test Passed`. Now for a closer look at each part.

## The Croqtile Function

This is the heart of the program. Here it is piece by piece.

**Function signature.**

```choreo
__co__ s32 [4, 8] ele_add(s32 [4, 8] lhs, s32 [4, 8] rhs) {
```

The `__co__` prefix marks this as a Croqtile function. Unlike regular C++ functions, the signature carries full shape information: `s32 [4, 8]` means "a 2D tensor of shape 4 × 8 with element type `s32` (signed 32-bit integer)." Both parameters and the return type follow this convention — `type [shape] name`. The compiler uses these shapes to verify that every indexing operation is in-bounds at compile time.

Croqtile supports these element types: `s32` (signed 32-bit int), `f16` (half-precision float), `bf16` (brain float), `f32` (single-precision float), and `f8_e4m3` / `f8_e5m2` (8-bit floats). For now, `s32` is the simplest to reason about.

**Output buffer declaration.**

```choreo
s32 [lhs.span] output;
```

This allocates the output tensor. The expression `lhs.span` copies the full shape from `lhs`, so `output` automatically has shape `[4, 8]`. If you later change the input shape, the output adjusts — a pattern that makes Croqtile functions easier to generalize.

**The computation.**

```choreo
parallel {i, j} by [4, 8]
  output.at(i, j) = lhs.at(i, j) + rhs.at(i, j);
```

`parallel {i, j} by [4, 8]` creates 4 × 8 = 32 parallel instances, one per element position. Each instance runs the body with its own `(i, j)` pair. The `.at(i, j)` accessor indexes into a tensor at position `(i, j)`, and the addition is direct — one element, one thread.

If you have written CUDA before, you might wonder: are these instances CUDA threads? Thread blocks? The short answer is that `parallel` without any annotation lets the compiler decide. Under the hood, the 32 instances here become 32 CUDA threads inside a single thread block — but Croqtile deliberately hides that mapping at this level. In [Chapter 3](ch03-parallelism.md) you will learn to control the mapping explicitly with **space specifiers** like `: block` and `: thread`, nest multiple `parallel` axes to build a block-and-thread hierarchy, and map them onto warps and warpgroups. For now, treat `parallel` as "run all instances concurrently on the GPU" and move on.

**Return.**

```choreo
return output;
```

A `__co__` function returns its result tensor. The return type in the signature (`s32 [4, 8]`) must match what you actually return. The caller on the host side receives a `choreo::spanned_data` — an owning buffer with shape metadata that you can index into with `[i][j]`.

## The Host Program

The host is plain C++ with a few Croqtile API calls:

```choreo
auto lhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(4, 8);
auto rhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(4, 8);
lhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
rhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
```

`choreo::make_spandata<T>(dims...)` creates an owning tensor buffer on the host. You pass the element type as a template parameter and the dimensions as arguments. `fill_random` populates it with values in the given range.

```choreo
auto res = ele_add(lhs.view(), rhs.view());
```

Calling a `__co__` function from C++ looks like a normal function call. The `.view()` method produces a non-owning `spanned_view` from an owning `spanned_data` — this is how you pass host tensors into a Croqtile function without transferring ownership. The return value `res` is a `choreo::spanned_data` that owns its buffer.

The rest of `main` is ordinary verification: loop over every element and assert equality. The host program is deliberately boring — the interesting work happens in the `__co__` function.

## Build and Compile

Croqtile files use the `.co` extension. The compiler works like `gcc` or `clang`:

```bash
croqtile ele_add.co                          # produces a.out
croqtile ele_add.co -o ele_add               # specify output name
croqtile -es -t cuda ele_add.co -o out.cu    # emit CUDA source only
```

The `-es` flag stops after transpilation, letting you inspect the generated CUDA code. The `-t` flag selects the target platform.

To see all available options, run `croqtile --help`:

```bash
croqtile --help
```

This prints the full set of compiler flags — output naming, target selection, verbosity, and diagnostic options. It is worth scanning once so you know what is available when you need it.

## What You Have So Far

The skeleton of every Croqtile program is now in your hands: a `__co__` function with typed, shaped parameters and a return value; `parallel` and `.at()` for element-wise computation; `lhs.span` for deriving output shapes from inputs; and the host-side `make_spandata` / `.view()` API for creating and passing tensors.

The example works, but it processes one element at a time with no control over how data moves through the memory hierarchy. On real hardware that matters — GPUs achieve peak throughput by moving data in bulk, not element by element. The [next chapter](ch02-data-movement.md) introduces `dma.copy` and `chunkat` to express block-level data movement.
