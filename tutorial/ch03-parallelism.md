# Parallelism: How Croktile Represents Parallel Work

The previous two chapters kept things simple: `parallel {i, j} by [4, 8]` created 32 instances, each handling one element, and we never asked where those instances actually ran. That was fine for element-wise addition and for understanding data movement — the compiler picked sensible defaults. But a GPU is not a flat bag of identical processors. It has a deep hierarchy of execution units, and mapping your work to the right level of that hierarchy is the difference between a toy demo and a real kernel.

This chapter introduces parallelism as a first-class concept in Croktile: what it means, how Croktile separates the *logical* structure (what runs concurrently) from the *physical* mapping (which hardware units run it), and how you control that mapping with **space specifiers**.

## How We Think About Parallel Tasks

Before we touch any Croktile syntax, let's talk about what "parallel" actually means.

Suppose you have eight independent tasks — eight tiles to add, eight rows to process, whatever. You can describe all eight at once and call them "parallel." But that statement says nothing about how many actually run at the same time. On a single CPU core, they execute one after another. On a 4-core CPU, maybe four run simultaneously. On a GPU warp, all eight might genuinely execute in lockstep.

![Virtual parallelism: same tasks, different hardware schedules](../assets/images/ch03/fig1_virtual_parallelism_light.png#only-light)

*The same eight tasks scheduled sequentially (1 core), 4-wide (CPU), and 8-wide (GPU). The tasks are identical — only the hardware changes.*

The point is that parallelism is a **virtual** concept. When you write "these eight tasks are independent," you are making a statement about the *logic* of your program, not about the hardware. The hardware decides how many actually run simultaneously, based on how many execution units it has and how the scheduler assigns work.

This distinction matters because GPU programming languages traditionally conflate the two. In CUDA, you launch a kernel with `<<<blocks, threads>>>` — that is simultaneously declaring the logical structure (how many instances) and the physical mapping (how many thread blocks, how many threads per block). If you want to change the tiling, you also have to change the launch configuration. The logical and physical are tangled together.

Croktile untangles them.

## Croktile's Two-Layer Parallelism Model

Croktile gives you two separate knobs:

1. **`parallel`** — declares that iterations are independent and *may* run concurrently. This is a logical statement.
2. **Space specifiers** (`: block`, `: thread`, `: group`, `: group-4`) — tell the compiler *which GPU hardware unit* each parallel axis maps to. This is a physical statement.

And there is `foreach`, which is the opposite of `parallel`: iterations run **sequentially**, in order. Use `foreach` when later iterations depend on earlier ones — an accumulation loop, a K-dimension reduction, a pipeline that loads tile *k* before computing with it.

```choreo
parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] : block    // concurrent — mapped to thread blocks
  foreach {tile_k} in [16]               // sequential — K-dimension loop
    parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread  // concurrent — mapped to threads
      foreach k in [16]                      // sequential — inner accumulation
        output += lhs * rhs;
```

The `parallel` lines say "these iterations are independent." The `: block` and `: thread` annotations say "put the outer ones on separate thread blocks and the inner ones on separate threads within a block." The `foreach` lines say "run these in order." No ambiguity, no conflation.

![Logical vs physical parallelism in Croktile](../assets/images/ch03/fig2_logical_vs_physical_dark.png#only-dark)
![Logical vs physical parallelism in Croktile](../assets/images/ch03/fig2_logical_vs_physical_light.png#only-light)

*Left: the logical nesting the programmer writes (parallel = concurrent, foreach = sequential). Right: the GPU hardware hierarchy. Space specifiers bridge the two.*

If you omit the space specifier — just `parallel p by 8` — the compiler picks a default mapping. That is what Chapters 1 and 2 did, and it worked fine for simple cases. Explicit specifiers are how you take control when performance matters.

Both `parallel` and `foreach` support multi-dimensional indices (`{a, b}` syntax), the compose operator (`#`), and the extent operator (`#p`). Everything from Chapters 1 and 2 still applies.

## Space Specifiers and Hardware Mapping

A GPU has a clear execution hierarchy. From coarsest to finest:

- A **thread block** (CTA) is a group of up to 1024 threads that share on-chip memory and can synchronize with each other.
- A **warpgroup** is four warps — 128 threads — that cooperate on wide matrix instructions (WGMMA on Hopper GPUs).
- A **warp** is 32 threads that execute in lockstep. This is the GPU's fundamental SIMD unit.
- A **thread** is a single execution context with its own registers.

Croktile maps to each level with a space specifier:

![Space specifiers mapped to GPU execution hierarchy](../assets/images/ch03/fig3_space_specifiers_dark.png#only-dark)
![Space specifiers mapped to GPU execution hierarchy](../assets/images/ch03/fig3_space_specifiers_light.png#only-light)

*The four space specifiers and the GPU hardware units they map to, with thread counts and typical operations at each level.*

### `: block` — Thread Blocks

```choreo
parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] : block
```

This creates an 8 × 16 = 128 block grid. Each block runs on a streaming multiprocessor (SM) and has its own allocation of shared memory. Blocks cannot communicate with each other during execution — they are truly independent.

Use `: block` for the outermost tiling of your output. If your output is `[128, 256]` and each block handles a `[16, 16]` tile, you need `128/16 × 256/16 = 8 × 16 = 128` blocks.

### `: thread` — Threads Within a Block

```choreo
parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread
```

This creates 16 × 16 = 256 threads within the enclosing block. Each thread has its own registers but shares on-chip memory with all other threads in the same block.

Use `: thread` for the finest-grain parallelism — the per-element work within a tile.

### `: group` — Warps

```choreo
parallel w by 4 : group
```

This creates 4 warps, each of 32 threads. Warps execute in lockstep (all 32 threads run the same instruction simultaneously). Warp-level operations like `mma.sync` (Ampere-era tensor core instructions) operate at this granularity.

### `: group-4` — Warpgroups

```choreo
parallel g by 2 : group-4
```

This creates 2 warpgroups, each containing 4 warps (128 threads). On Hopper GPUs (compute capability 9.0+), WGMMA instructions require a full warpgroup to cooperate. Even when you have just one warpgroup (`parallel p by 1 : group-4`), the annotation tells the compiler that these 128 threads form a cooperative unit.

Multiple warpgroups per block is how you scale work along one dimension without adding more blocks — both warpgroups share the same shared memory but maintain independent accumulators. Chapter 4 puts this to work with tensor-core operations.

### Nesting Specifiers

Real kernels nest these levels. A common pattern:

```choreo
parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] : block {
  parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread {
    // 128 blocks × 256 threads = 32,768 threads total
  }
}
```

The outer `parallel` creates the block grid. The inner `parallel` creates threads within each block. The braces `{px, py}` introduce multi-dimensional indices — shorthand for two nested `parallel` lines.

### How `shared` Enables Reuse

Space specifiers interact directly with memory specifiers. Recall from Chapter 2 that `dma.copy ... => shared` places data in block-scoped shared memory, while `=> local` places data in thread-private local memory.

The choice matters because of data reuse. Consider a tile that every thread in a block needs to read:

![Local vs shared memory reuse](../assets/images/ch03/fig4_shared_reuse_dark.png#only-dark)
![Local vs shared memory reuse](../assets/images/ch03/fig4_shared_reuse_light.png#only-light)

*Left: with `=> local`, each thread loads its own copy — 4× the bandwidth. Right: with `=> shared`, one DMA fills shared memory and all threads read from it — 1× the bandwidth.*

The rule of thumb: if multiple threads in a block need the same data, copy it into `shared`. If each thread's working set is independent, `local` keeps data closer and avoids shared-memory bank contention.

In the matmul later in this chapter, the K-tiles of `lhs` and `rhs` are loaded `=> shared` because all 256 threads in the block read from them. The output accumulator stays in registers (thread-private) because each thread writes to its own element.

## Type System Aside: `mdspan` and `ituple`

Before we build the matmul, two features of Croktile's type system are worth mentioning. You have already used them implicitly; now is a good time to name them.

**`mdspan`** — every tensor in Croktile carries its shape as part of its type. When you write `s32 [128, 256] lhs`, the shape `[128, 256]` is not a runtime value — it is a compile-time property. The compiler uses it to verify that every `.at()`, `chunkat`, and `dma.copy` is dimensionally consistent. If you try `lhs.at(i, j, k)` on a 2D tensor, the compiler rejects it. The expression `output.at(px#qx, py#qy)` is verified to produce indices within the output's bounds.

The `span(i)` syntax extracts one dimension: `lhs.span(0)` is 128, `rhs.span(1)` is 256. The shorthand `lhs.span` copies the entire shape.

**`ituple`** — the `{px, py}` syntax in `parallel {px, py} by [8, 16]` introduces an `ituple`, a compile-time integer tuple. The compose operator `px#qx` combines two ituple elements into a global index. The extent operator `#p` extracts the range of a parallel variable. These are all resolved at compile time — no runtime overhead.

For the full details, see the [mdspan reference](../documentation/shape-in-choreo.md) and the [ituple reference](../documentation/integer-ituple.md). For now, the key takeaway is: Croktile catches shape mismatches at compile time, not at runtime.

## Matrix Multiply: Putting It Together

With `parallel`, `foreach`, `dma.copy`, `chunkat`, `#`, and space specifiers, a tiled matrix multiply is within reach. This is the first program in the tutorial that does something GPUs are famous for.

The plan: multiply a `[128, 256]` matrix by a `[256, 256]` matrix to get a `[128, 256]` result.

### Scalar Matmul (No DMA)

Start with just `parallel` and `.at()` — global memory, no explicit data movement:

```choreo
__co__ s32 [128, 256] matmul(s32 [128, 256] lhs, s32 [256, 256] rhs) {
  s32 [lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output;

  parallel p by 16, q by 64 {
    foreach index = {m, n, k} in [128 / #p, 256 / #q, 256]
      output.at(p#m, q#n) += lhs.at(p#m, k) * rhs.at(k, q#n);
  }

  return output;
}
```

![Scalar matmul output tiling grid](../assets/images/ch03/fig5_scalar_matmul_dark.png#only-dark)
![Scalar matmul output tiling grid](../assets/images/ch03/fig5_scalar_matmul_light.png#only-light)

*The [128, 256] output divided into a 16 × 64 tile grid. Each (p, q) pair owns one tile.*

This is dense — here is what each piece does.

**Output shape from operand dimensions.** `s32 [lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output` builds the output shape from the inputs: `lhs.span(0)` is 128 (rows of the left matrix) and `rhs.span(1)` is 256 (columns of the right matrix).

**Multi-axis parallel.** `parallel p by 16, q by 64` declares two parallel indices with a comma. This creates a 16 × 64 = 1024-way parallel grid. Each `(p, q)` pair owns a tile of the output.

**Named tuple destructuring.** `foreach index = {m, n, k} in [128 / #p, 256 / #q, 256]` introduces three nested loop indices — `m`, `n`, `k` — bound to a tuple called `index`. The trip counts are:

- `128 / #p = 128 / 16 = 8` rows per tile
- `256 / #q = 256 / 64 = 4` columns per tile
- `256` for the full contraction dimension

**Composed global indices.** `p#m` composes the tile index with the within-tile offset. `p` selects which of the 16 row-tiles, `m` runs 0..7 within that tile, so `p#m` covers 0..127 across all tiles.

**The arithmetic.** `output.at(p#m, q#n) += lhs.at(p#m, k) * rhs.at(k, q#n)` is the textbook dot product: for each output element, sum products along K. Every `.at()` here reads from global memory.

### DMA Matmul: Tiles in Shared Memory

The scalar version works but every multiply reads from global memory. Bringing K-tiles into shared memory lets all threads in a block reuse them:

```choreo
__co__ s32 [128, 256] matmul(s32 [128, 256] lhs, s32 [256, 256] rhs) {
  s32 [lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output;

  parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] : block {
    foreach {tile_k} in [16] {
      lhs_load = dma.copy lhs.chunkat(px, tile_k) => shared;
      rhs_load = dma.copy rhs.chunkat(tile_k, py) => shared;

      parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread {
        foreach k in [256 / #tile_k]
          output.at(px#qx, py#qy) += lhs_load.data.at(qx, k) * rhs_load.data.at(k, qy);
      }
    }
  }

  return output;
}
```

![DMA matmul: block grid with shared memory and K-loop](../assets/images/ch03/fig6_dma_matmul_dark.png#only-dark)
![DMA matmul: block grid with shared memory and K-loop](../assets/images/ch03/fig6_dma_matmul_light.png#only-light)

*One block in detail: the K-loop loads lhs and rhs tiles into shared memory via `dma.copy`, then 256 threads compute partial products from the shared copies.*

What changed from the scalar version:

1. The outer `parallel` now uses `: block` with brace-form indices `{px, py}`. An 8 × 16 grid of blocks covers the output.

2. A `foreach` over `tile_k` walks the K dimension in 16 steps. Each step copies one strip of `lhs` and one strip of `rhs` into `shared` memory with `dma.copy ... => shared`.

3. An inner `parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread` creates 256 threads within each block. Each thread owns one output element within the block's tile.

4. The arithmetic reads from `lhs_load.data` and `rhs_load.data` — the shared-memory copies — instead of global `lhs` and `rhs`.

The composed indices work in two layers: `px#qx` composes block index `px` with thread index `qx` to form the global row; `py#qy` does the same for columns.

**Dimension arithmetic.** With `[8, 16]` blocks, each block owns `128/8 = 16` rows and `256/16 = 16` columns. The inner `[16, 16]` threads subdivide that into one element per thread. Along K, 16 tiles of `256/16 = 16` elements each cover the full contraction.

### GPU Resource Layout

Here is how the matmul code maps to actual GPU hardware:

![Matmul code mapped to GPU resources](../assets/images/ch03/fig7_matmul_gpu_layout_dark.png#only-dark)
![Matmul code mapped to GPU resources](../assets/images/ch03/fig7_matmul_gpu_layout_light.png#only-light)

*Left: Croktile code with nested parallel and foreach. Right: GPU hardware — 128 blocks distributed across SMs, each with shared memory and 256 threads.*

### Host Code

The host side uses the same `make_spandata` / `.view()` pattern from earlier chapters:

```choreo
int main() {
  auto lhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(128, 256);
  auto rhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(256, 256);
  lhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = matmul(lhs.view(), rhs.view());

  for (size_t i = 0; i < res.shape()[0]; ++i)
    for (size_t j = 0; j < res.shape()[1]; ++j) {
      int ref = 0;
      for (size_t k = 0; k < lhs.shape()[1]; ++k)
        ref += lhs[i][k] * rhs[k][j];
      choreo::choreo_assert(ref == res[i][j], "values are not equal.");
    }

  std::cout << "Test Passed\n" << std::endl;
}
```

Nothing new here. The host program stays boring so the Croktile function stays the star.

## Tracing One Output Element

Pick global position `(row=37, col=50)` in the output. Which block and thread own it?

Blocks partition 128 rows into 8 tiles of 16: `px = 37 / 16 = 2`, offset `qx = 37 % 16 = 5`. Columns partition 256 into 16 tiles of 16: `py = 50 / 16 = 3`, offset `qy = 50 % 16 = 2`. So block `(2, 3)`, thread `(5, 2)`.

For that thread, the K-loop runs 16 iterations. On iteration `tile_k = 0`, `dma.copy` loads `lhs` rows 32..47 and K columns 0..15 into shared `lhs_load`, and `rhs` K rows 0..15 and columns 48..63 into shared `rhs_load`. The inner `foreach k in [16]` accumulates `lhs_load.data.at(5, k) * rhs_load.data.at(k, 2)` for k = 0..15 into `output.at(37, 50)`. Then `tile_k = 1` loads the next K-strip, and so on. After all 16 iterations, `output.at(37, 50)` holds the complete dot product — same answer as the scalar reference.

## Summary of New Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `parallel p by N` | N-way parallelism, index `p` runs 0..N-1 concurrently |
| `parallel {px, py} by [M, N]` | Multi-dimensional parallel (Cartesian product) |
| `parallel p by N : block` | Map to CUDA thread blocks |
| `parallel q by N : thread` | Map to threads within a block |
| `parallel w by N : group` | Map to warps (32 threads each) |
| `parallel g by N : group-4` | Map to warpgroups (128 threads each) |
| `=> shared` | DMA destination: block-scoped shared memory |
| `foreach index = {m, n, k} in [a, b, c]` | Named tuple destructuring in a `foreach` |
| `parallel p by A, q by B` | Comma-separated parallel axes |
| `lhs.span(0)` | Extract one dimension of a tensor's shape |
| `p#m` | Compose outer tile index `p` with inner offset `m` |

The tiled DMA matmul you built in this chapter is the structural backbone of every high-performance GPU kernel. The next chapter replaces the scalar `.at()` arithmetic in the inner loop with **tensor-core** operations — hardware-accelerated matrix multiply that processes a 16×16×16 tile in a single instruction.
