# Multi-Warpgroup Matmul: Scaling with Multiple Accumulators

Chapter 7 introduced **persistent** matmul kernels: one CTA can sweep many output tiles with `step` and guards, amortizing launch overhead and improving occupancy on large problems. This chapter stays inside a **single** CTA but asks a different scaling question: **how do you make one block responsible for a wider slice of M than a single warpgroup can natively cover?**

On Hopper-class hardware, **WGMMA** (warp-group matrix multiply-accumulate) typically cooperates across **four warps** — 128 threads — per **warpgroup**. One such group naturally “owns” a **64×64** FP16 result tile in the configuration we use here (`MATMUL_WARP_M = 64`, `MATMUL_WARP_N = 64`). That is a comfortable, hardware-aligned unit. If you stop there, each CUDA block’s footprint along M is also 64 rows unless you add more warpgroups.

**Multi-warpgroup** kernels raise the **block tile height** along M — for example to **128** rows — by running **two** warpgroups in parallel inside the same block. Each warpgroup keeps its **own** FP32 accumulator `mc`, loads **different** rows of the left-hand matrix **A** from shared memory, but reuses the **same** **B** tile already sitting in shared. After the K loop, each group stores **its** 64×64 piece of the result into a shared staging buffer; one TMA (or wide copy) then writes the full **128×64** tile to global memory.

The payoff is familiar from tiling theory: **larger per-block tiles** mean **fewer blocks** for the same matrix dimensions, which reduces **grid launch overhead**, improves **data reuse** of **B** within the block, and often helps **SM utilization** — provided the larger shared-memory and register footprint still fits your target.

You might ask: **why not** keep **one** warpgroup per block and simply use **more** blocks along M? That design is valid and often easier to reason about. Multi-warpgroup layouts earn their keep when **B** reuse across the **M** split is strong: **one** TMA brings **B** into shared, and **two** groups multiply **different** row bundles of **A** against **that same** **B** without a second global read of **B** for the second **M** stripe. You still pay for **A** at the **full** **128×K** footprint per **K** step, but you **halve** the **B** traffic **per result row bundle** in the sense that two **64×64** result patches share one **B** slab. Whether that wins over a simpler kernel is **empirical**; the Choreo pattern exists so you can express the layout cleanly and let the compiler target WGMMA.

The rest of this chapter walks the benchmark kernel line by line, then generalizes the **`parallel p1 by N : group-4`** idiom and collects pitfalls that show up in real tuning.

Keep a copy of **`matmul_f16_dynamic_mwg_impl_1.co`** open in your editor while you read. The prose quotes the **Choreo function** accurately, but the **C++** file is where **asserts**, **timing**, and **preprocessor** guards live.

## One warpgroup vs. two: the M axis

Fix these sizes in your head (they match `matmul_f16_dynamic_mwg_impl_1.co` in the Choreo benchmarks):

| Symbol | Value | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| `MATMUL_WARP_M` | 64 | Rows of C one warpgroup contributes |
| `MATMUL_WARP_N` | 64 | Columns of C one warpgroup contributes |
| `MATMUL_TILE_M` | 128 | **Block** tile height along M (two warpgroups) |
| `MATMUL_TILE_N` | 64 | Matches `WARP_N`; block width along N |
| `MATMUL_TILE_K` | 64 | K chunk per TMA slice into shared |
| `MATMUL_WARP_K` | 16 | K step per inner `mma.load` / `mma.row.row` |
| `MATMUL_SWIZ` | 128 | Swizzle parameter for TMA + MMA (here `2 * TILE_K`) |

So **`TILE_M = 2 × WARP_M`**: the **block** owns a **128×64** output rectangle, and **two** warpgroups split it **along M** into two **64×64** panes. Along **N**, there is no split at the warpgroup level in this kernel — both groups work on the same **N** span, which is exactly **`WARP_N`**.

The **key insight** for reading the code: **the right-hand tile in shared memory is shared**. `rhs_load_s` has shape **`[MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K]`** — enough for **one** **B** slab for this block’s column stripe. **Both** warpgroups read that same buffer (via `rhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp)`), while **left-hand** data is **partitioned** by warpgroup index **`p1`**.

## `parallel p1 by 2 : group-4`

Choreo expresses multiple warpgroups with **`parallel`** over a small index, here **`p1`**, with a **`group`** annotation that says how many warps cooperate per group:

```choreo
parallel p1 by 2 : group-4 {
  // body: two iterations (p1 = 0 and 1), each a warpgroup of 4 warps
}
```

Read **`by 2`** as “**two** warpgroup instances in this block.” Read **`: group-4`** as “**each** instance is a **warp group** of **four** warps” (128 threads), which is the usual WGMMA thread team on Hopper.

Outside this region, the block still has a single **K** loop and shared buffers. Inside, **`p1`** selects **which** of the two groups is executing — and that index drives **which slice of `lhs_load_s`** and **which slice of `output_s`** this group uses.

The **128 threads** per warpgroup matter for how the hardware executes **`mma.row.row`**: WGMMA is a **collective** on a **warp group**, not a single warp. Choreo’s **`: group-4`** states that requirement in the Choreo function so the lowering path can target the right instruction shape. When you read vendor documentation that says **“four warps cooperate”**, map that directly to **`group-4`** here.

You can read **`p1`** as a **compile-time** or **Choreo-level** lane ID: it is not a runtime loop counter over threads inside one warp. It partitions **which warpgroup** owns **which strip** of the block’s **M** dimension in shared and in **`mc`**.

## Full kernel walkthrough

Below is the **Choreo function** core of the benchmark kernel (eliding C++ harness). Compare it mentally to a single-warpgroup Hopper matmul: the **TMA loads** and **output tile** are sized for **`TILE_M`**, while **compute** is duplicated in shape but **split** across **`p1`**.

The listing is the **authoritative** shape reference; the prose that follows names each region — grid, shared sizing, **K** loop, **store**, epilog **TMA**, and **swizzle** — without subsection headings so you can read it straight through.

**`__co__ void matmul`** is the Choreo entry point the C++ driver launches; the **`global`** tensors are the usual row-major **A**, **B**, and **C** views at the problem scale. Everything inside **`parallel {block_m, block_n} … : block`** is what a single CUDA CTA executes.

```choreo
__co__ void matmul(global f16 [M, K] lhs, global f16 [N, K] rhs, global f16 [M, N] output) {
  parallel {block_m, block_n} by [cdiv(M, MATMUL_TILE_M), cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N)] : block {
    shared f16 [MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_TILE_K] lhs_load_s;
    shared f16 [MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K] rhs_load_s;
    shared f16 [MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_WARP_N] output_s;

    mc = mma.fill.f32 0.0f;
    foreach {iv_k} in [cdiv(K, MATMUL_TILE_K)] {
      tma.copy.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> lhs.subspan(MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(block_m, iv_k) => lhs_load_s;
      tma.copy.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> rhs.chunkat(block_n, iv_k) => rhs_load_s;
      parallel p1 by 2 : group-4 {
        foreach {iv_warp} in [cdiv(MATMUL_TILE_K, MATMUL_WARP_K)] {
          ma = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> lhs_load_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(p1, 0).chunkat(_, iv_warp);
          mb = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> rhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp);
          mma.row.row mc, ma, mb;
        }
      }
    }
    parallel p1 by 2 : group-4 {
      mma.store mc, output_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(p1, 0);
    }
    tma.copy output_s => output.subspan(MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(block_m, block_n);
  }
}
```

**`mc = mma.fill.f32 0.0f`** sits in **block** scope **outside** the **`p1`** regions. After lowering, each warpgroup still receives **its own** accumulator state; read the line as “zero the **MMA** accumulators before the **K** loop,” the same high-level intent as in single-warpgroup matmuls from earlier chapters.

The outer `parallel {block_m, block_n}` uses **`cdiv(M, MATMUL_TILE_M)`** along M — each block covers **128** rows — and **`cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N)`** along N. Note the **asymmetry**: **N** is stepped in units of **`WARP_N` (64)**, not **`TILE_N`**, because the inner compute is already sized to **64** columns per group and this kernel does not stack multiple groups along N.

In logical coordinates, name the **output** tile this block owns **`C[block_m, block_n]`**: a **128×64** submatrix of the full **`output`**. Index **`block_m`** advances in steps of **128** along **M**; **`block_n`** advances in steps of **64** along **N**. That matches how **`lhs.subspan(MATMUL_TILE_M, …).at(block_m, …)`** strides down **M** and how **`rhs.chunkat(block_n, …)`** selects the **N** stripe of **B** (stored as **`[N, K]`** in this kernel) that multiplies into those **128** rows of **A**.

**`lhs_load_s`** holds the full **A** tile for this block and **K** chunk: shape **`[128, 64]`** in index units matching **`MATMUL_TILE_M × MATMUL_TILE_K`**. **`rhs_load_s`** is **`[64, 64]`** — one **B** tile; **both** warpgroups consume it. **`output_s`** is **`[128, 64]`** — staging for the **entire** block result before the final TMA to global.

In **bytes**, the dominant pieces scale with **`TILE_M`**: **`lhs_load_s`** and **`output_s`** are **FP16**, so each is **`128 × 64 × 2`** bytes per **K** slab for **A** (one slab resident at a time in this simple version) plus the staged **C** tile. **`rhs_load_s`** stays **`64 × 64 × 2`**. When you add warpgroups along **M**, **A** and **C** staging grow **linearly** with **`TILE_M`**; **B** staging does **not**, which is exactly the **reuse** story.

You should still account for **bank** behavior and **alignment** when you sum shared usage for launch bounds — the raw element counts above are a first pass; Chapter 4’s **swizzle** discussion is what ties those shapes to conflict-free **`mma.load`**.

For each **`iv_k`**, TMA fills **`lhs_load_s`** with the **`MATMUL_TILE_M × MATMUL_TILE_K`** slab from global **`lhs`** at **`(block_m, iv_k)`**, then fills **`rhs_load_s`** from **`rhs`** at this block’s column **`block_n`** and the same **K** slice. Then **`parallel p1 by 2 : group-4`** runs the **math**.

**`ma`** — `lhs_load_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(p1, 0)` — is a **`64 × 64`** view of **`lhs_load_s`**: row offset **`p1 * 64`**, column offset **0**, so **`p1 = 0`** gets the **top** half of the **A** tile and **`p1 = 1`** the **bottom** half. **`mb`** — `rhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp)` — does **not** depend on **`p1`**: every warpgroup loads the **same** **B** stripes as **`iv_warp`** advances along **K**. **`mma.row.row mc, ma, mb`** gives each group **its own** **`mc`** (conceptually a per-group accumulator), accumulating **its** **A** rows against the **shared** **B** data. The inner **`foreach {iv_warp}`** walks **`TILE_K / WARP_K = 4`** steps along **K** inside shared memory, matching the usual blocked MMA pattern.

Fix **`block_m`**, **`block_n`**, and **`iv_k`** for a moment. TMA lands **128×64** **A** and **64×64** **B** in shared. For **`p1 = 0`**, **`ma`** sees rows **0…63** of **`lhs_load_s`**; for **`p1 = 1`**, **64…127**. For **both**, **`mb`** cycles **four** **K**-shards of **`rhs_load_s`**. After this **`iv_k`**, each **`mc`** holds the **partial** sum for **its** **64×64** **C** patch over **K** so far; the outer **`foreach {iv_k}`** runs until **K** is exhausted. **TMA** appears before the **`parallel p1 by 2`** nest on purpose: **shared** must hold the new **A** and **B** slabs before **`mma.load`**. Real code may use **async** TMA and **barriers**; the Choreo function still states **dependences** like a synchronous kernel. If you **pipeline** two **K** buffers, the **multi-warpgroup** split is unchanged: each **phase** still ends with **both** groups seeing **consistent** **`lhs_load_s`** and **`rhs_load_s`**.

After **K**, each warpgroup still holds **its** **`mc`** in registers (or the lowering’s equivalent). A second **`parallel p1 by 2 : group-4`** stores each **`mc`** into **`output_s`** — flushing accumulators into shared before global writeback:

```choreo
mma.store mc, output_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(p1, 0);
```

This mirrors the **load** geometry: **`subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(p1, 0)`** addresses a **64×64** window inside the **128×64** **`output_s`**, so the two groups **do not stomp** each other’s outputs. Then

```choreo
tma.copy output_s => output.subspan(MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(block_m, block_n);
```

writes the **complete** **128×64** staged tile to global **`output`**. From the host’s perspective, this block has computed the same result as a hypothetical kernel with **smaller** **M** tiles and **more** blocks — but with **half** as many blocks along **M** for this configuration.

Chapter 4 tied **TMA swizzle** to **shared-memory** behavior and **MMA** operand layout. Here **`MATMUL_SWIZ = 128`** matches **`2 * MATMUL_TILE_K`**, enforced by **`#if`** checks in the benchmark source. **Swizzle** applies **uniformly** to **`lhs_load_s`** and **`rhs_load_s`**: **`p1`** only shifts the **origin** of **`ma`** inside **`lhs_load_s`** via **`.at(p1, 0)`**; it does **not** imply a different swizzle mode per group. If you change **`TILE_K`**, update **swizzle** and re-validate **TMA** and **`mma.load`** together — the **multi-warpgroup** pattern does not relax those constraints.

## Extending to more warpgroups along M

The two-group kernel is the smallest nontrivial case. Generalizing to **`by 3`**, **`by 4`**, and so on is mostly arithmetic on **`TILE_M`**, shared sizes, and grid **`cdiv`** — the **invariant** is still **one** **`rhs_load_s`** per **N** stripe when you only subdivide **M**.

Nothing in the pattern is special to **two**. If hardware resources allow, you can set **`MATMUL_TILE_M = 192`** with **`MATMUL_WARP_M = 64`**, use **`parallel p1 by 3 : group-4`**, and keep the same **shared** **`rhs_load_s`** while **`lhs_load_s`** and **`output_s`** grow to **192×64**. Each **`p1`** would select **`subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, …).at(p1, 0)`** with **`p1 ∈ {0,1,2}`**. The same story applies for larger **multiples** as long as **`TILE_M`** remains divisible by **`WARP_M`** and you respect target-specific limits on warpgroups per block, shared memory, and registers.

**N-side** scaling is a **different** design fork. This chapter’s kernel keeps **`parallel p1`** strictly on the **M** split. If you also want **two** **64×64** patches **along N**, you typically introduce **another** parallel axis (or **another** **block** dimension) and **either** **replicate** or **partition** **B** accordingly — you **cannot** blindly keep a **single** **`rhs_load_s`** sized **`[64,64]`** if **each** group needs **disjoint** **N** data. The **M-only** split is the **sweet spot** for **one B tile** serving **many A row bundles**.

If you generalize to **`MATMUL_TILE_M = 192`**, the Choreo function changes only where **counts** and **buffer sizes** appear — the **pattern** is unchanged:

```choreo
shared f16 [192, MATMUL_TILE_K] lhs_load_s;
shared f16 [MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K] rhs_load_s;
shared f16 [192, MATMUL_WARP_N] output_s;
// ...
parallel p1 by 3 : group-4 {
  foreach {iv_warp} in [cdiv(MATMUL_TILE_K, MATMUL_WARP_K)] {
    ma = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ>
      lhs_load_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(p1, 0).chunkat(_, iv_warp);
    mb = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> rhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp);
    mma.row.row mc, ma, mb;
  }
}
parallel p1 by 3 : group-4 {
  mma.store mc, output_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(p1, 0);
}
```

The **`rhs_load_s`** declaration is **identical** to the two-group case: still **`[64, 64]`** in **K** for this **N** stripe. Only **`lhs_load_s`**, **`output_s`**, and **`by 3`** track the taller **M** tile. Your **grid** along **M** becomes **`cdiv(M, 192)`** instead of **`cdiv(M, 128)`**.

Each extra warpgroup adds **another** full **`mc`** accumulator state and **another** **`mma.row.row`** stream in parallel with the others. Before you chase **`by 4`** or **`by 5`**, check the benchmark’s register and shared statics in the build log — **Hopper** gives a lot of headroom, but **occupancy** still collapses if **per-thread** state grows without bound.

## Practical considerations

When you see **`TILE_M`** and **`WARP_M`** in the same kernel, treat **`TILE_*`** as sizing **shared memory and TMA** for what **the whole block** owns in one shot. Treat **`WARP_*`** (or **`group-4`** MMA geometry) as sizing **each warpgroup’s** compute and accumulator for **one** Tensor Core “team” worth of output rows/columns. **B** is **replicated in use** (one copy in shared, many readers), not **replicated in storage**; **A** is **split** so each group only **loads** the rows it **owns**.

Two bugs show up often when you **first** sketch multi-warpgroup matmuls by analogy with **multi-warp** Ampere kernels. **Indexing `rhs` with `p1`** — if **`mb`** accidentally depended on **`p1`**, you would be telling a story where **different** groups need **different** **B** tiles — at that point you usually want **different** **`block_n`** or an **N-side** split, not a second **M** group reading the same **`rhs_load_s`**. **Forgetting to partition `output_s`** — if both groups **`mma.store`** to **`output_s.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(0, 0)`**, the **second** group **overwrites** the **first**. The **`.at(p1, 0)`** on **store** is not decorative; it is the **same** **M-axis** addressing as on **`ma`**. Also watch **occupancy**: **doubling** **`TILE_M`** grows **`lhs_load_s`** and **`output_s`** roughly **linearly** in that dimension. **Shared** limits can **push** you to **fewer** resident blocks per SM even as **arithmetic intensity** improves. Profile **both** **throughput** and **occupancy** when you change **`TILE_M`** or the **number** of groups.

Choreo’s **`subspan`** and **`.at(p1, 0)`** compose the same way whether you have one warpgroup or four. **`subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K)`** declares a **window** whose **height** is **64** rows and **width** is the full **K** chunk (**64**) sitting in **`lhs_load_s`**. That window is **logically** a **64×64** matrix for each **`iv_warp`** step after **`chunkat(_, iv_warp)`** narrows along **K**. **`.at(p1, 0)`** then **slides** that window **down** the **M** axis: **`p1 = 0`** anchors at row **0** of **`lhs_load_s`**, **`p1 = 1`** at row **64**. The second index **0** is the column anchor inside the **subspan** — here the **left** edge of the **K** chunk, because the **entire** **TILE_K** width is already addressed by **`subspan(..., MATMUL_TILE_K)`** and the **`chunkat`** picks **which 16-column stripe** (for **`WARP_K = 16`**) participates in this **`mma.row.row`**.

The **store** line repeats the **same** **subspan** shape and **same** **`.at(p1, 0)`**, but the buffer is **`output_s`** instead of **`lhs_load_s`**. That **symmetry** is deliberate: whatever **rows** of **A** a group used to **form** its **`mc`**, it writes **`mc`** back to the **matching** **rows** of the **staged** **C** tile. If **load** and **store** ever disagree on **`p1`**, you have a **silent** correctness bug — the kind **unit tests** catch quickly if **M** and **N** are small enough to **eyeball** a full matrix.

Chapter 7’s **persistent** kernels reuse **one** CTA across **many** tiles by **iterating** **`block_m` / `block_n`** in software. This chapter’s **multi-warpgroup** layout reuses **B** across **two** accumulators **within** one tile iteration. In a full production stack you might **combine** both: persistent scheduling **and** multiple warpgroups per tile, trading **even more** launch and DRAM traffic overhead for **higher** per-SM work — always subject to occupancy and memory capacity.

If you are reading the chapters in order: Chapter 5 set up **MMA** lifecycle and **warp** vs **block** tiles; Chapter 4’s **TMA + swizzle** is exactly what feeds **`lhs_load_s`** and **`rhs_load_s`** here; Chapter 7’s **persistence** is about **how many tiles** a CTA visits, not **how wide** each tile is along **M**. This chapter sits at the intersection — **wider tiles** without **wider** **B** storage.

None of that ordering is mandatory for correctness here: you could read this chapter first and still understand the kernel if you treat **Chapter 7** as “optional background on **persistent** scheduling.” The **dataflow** inside one block stands on its own.

The repository path **`choreo/benchmark/performance/matmul/matmul_f16_dynamic_mwg_impl_1.co`** contains the full **C++** harness (timing, verification, CLI flags) around the **`__co__ void matmul`** you saw above. The **preprocessor** block at the top is worth skimming even if you never change the constants: it encodes **WGMMA** shape rules (**`WARP_M`**, **`WARP_K`**), **swizzle** legality, and **`TILE_M % WARP_M`**. Treat those **`#error`** lines as **documentation** that happens to be executable — when you bump **`TILE_K`**, the compiler will refuse combinations that break **FP16** Hopper assumptions instead of failing mysteriously at runtime.

**Check your understanding.**

**Why is `rhs_load_s` not shaped `[MATMUL_TILE_M, MATMUL_TILE_K]`?** Matrix **B** only needs **as many N rows as the block’s N tile** and **as many K columns as the current slab**. Here the **N** tile width is **64**, matching **`WARP_N`**. Doubling **`TILE_M`** does not double the **N** dimension of **B** for this block — both **64×64** result patches sit in the **same** **N** column range, so **one** **`rhs_load_s`** suffices.

**Could both groups use the same `ma` slices?** No — that would compute the **same** **64×64** output twice instead of **two** **different** row bundles of **C**; you need **two** **independent** accumulators because **two** **different** slices of **A** participate.

**Does `p1` ever appear in the global TMA source coordinates?** Not here: **global** **A** loads **once** per **K** iteration as a **128×64** tile into **`lhs_load_s`**, and **partitioning** happens **after** the data is **in shared**, via **`subspan` / `.at`**. That keeps **TMA** descriptors **simple** and avoids **two** overlapping **A** loads.

## Single warpgroup vs. this kernel (at a glance)

Use the **one-warpgroup** column when you want the simplest story: one **`mc`**, one **`lhs_load_s`** height equal to **`WARP_M`**, and a dense grid of **64×64** tiles. Move to the **two-warpgroup** column when **B** reuse across **two** **M** strips in the **same** block pays for the extra **A** staging and the second **`parallel p1`** region.

| Aspect | One **`group-4`** warpgroup per block | Two warpgroups (**this chapter**) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Output tile per block** | **64×64** (with these **`WARP_*`**) | **128×64** |
| **`lhs_load_s` height** | **64** | **128** |
| **`rhs_load_s` shape** | **64×64** | **unchanged** — still **one** **B** tile |
| **Blocks along M** (fixed **M**) | **`cdiv(M, 64)`** | **`cdiv(M, 128)`** |
| **Accumulators** | one **`mc`** per group | **two** **`mc`** instances (**one** per **`p1`**) |
| **Parallel pattern** | **`parallel p1 by 1 : group-4`** (or implicit single group) | **`parallel p1 by 2 : group-4`** |

The table is **schematic**: real single-warpgroup kernels might still use **`TILE_M = 128`** with **more** warps doing **non-MMA** work, or different **N** tiling. The point is to separate **“how tall is shared **A**?”** from **“how many WGMMA teams share one **B**?”** — this chapter’s answer is **128** and **two**.

A **single** warpgroup on this path naturally covers **64×64** of the result; **two** groups inside one block cover **128×64** by **splitting A and C along M** and **sharing B**. **`parallel p1 by 2 : group-4`** launches **two** **128-thread** warpgroups; **`p1`** indexes which **M** slice each group owns in **`lhs_load_s`** and **`output_s`**. **`rhs_load_s`** is **one** tile per **K** step; both groups read it, which is the **main reuse win** versus launching separate blocks for each **64-row** strip. **`mma.store`** uses the **same** **`subspan(…).at(p1, 0)`** idiom as **`mma.load`** so each accumulator lands in the correct **half** of **`output_s`**.

The benchmark source **`matmul_f16_dynamic_mwg_impl_1.co`** is a concrete reference implementation with preprocessor checks (for example **`TILE_M` divisible by `WARP_M`**, **`SWIZ` tied to `TILE_K`**) that guard the assumptions this chapter relied on. When you tune tile sizes, start from those constraints and measure — **larger blocks** are not automatically faster, but **multi-warpgroup** layout is the standard way to grow **M** without giving up **WGMMA**’s native **64-row** chunks.

**Next:** [Chapter 9 — Beyond `chunkat`: `view` and `from` for irregular access](ch09-view-from.md) continues the tutorial with more flexible indexing when rigid **`subspan`** / **`chunkat`** tiles are not enough.
