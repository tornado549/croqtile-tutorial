# Persistent Matmul: if-guards, step, and Tile Iteration

In Chapter 4 you saw a Hopper-style FP16 matrix multiply whose **grid** was sized directly from the problem: one CUDA **thread block** (CTA) per output tile, via `parallel {block_m, block_n} by [cdiv(M, ...), cdiv(N, ...)] : block`. That pattern is easy to reason about: each block owns one **`MATMUL_WARP_M × MATMUL_WARP_N`** region of the output, loads K-panels with TMA, accumulates with WGMMA, and stores the result. Chapter 6 added **warp specialization** inside that story—different warps playing different roles in a pipelined loop.

This chapter changes the **launch geometry**. Instead of spawning as many CTAs as there are output tiles, you launch a **fixed** number of blocks—here, one per streaming multiprocessor (SM)—and let each block **iterate** over many tiles in software. That is the **persistent kernel** pattern: a small, steady pool of CTAs that keeps working until the whole output is covered.

When **`tiles_m * tiles_n`** dwarfs the SM count, a data-dependent grid schedules work in **waves**; the last wave leaves some SMs idle while others finish (**tail underutilization**). A fixed CTA count stripes logical tiles across blocks so each worker keeps pulling work as long as another tile is assigned to it.

You will **linearize** output tiles and assign them with **`tile_iter # block_id`**, guard out-of-range work with **`if (tile_id < total_tiles)`**, and spell strides with **`.step(M, K)`** on **`subspan`** when you want them explicit. **Integer division and remainder** recover **`(block_m, block_n)`** from a linear **`tile_id`**. **`NUM_SMS`** sets the launch width, and **`cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)`** is the shared outer loop bound every block uses.

The reference for this chapter is the **static persistent** FP16 matmul on SM90 in Choreo’s benchmarks: `choreo/benchmark/performance/matmul/matmul_f16_dyn_persis_sta_sm90.co`. The **`__co__`** body below matches that kernel’s structure (constants follow the listing).

```choreo
__co__ void matmul(global f16 [M, K] lhs, global f16 [N, K] rhs, global f16 [M, N] output) {
  int total_tiles = cdiv(M, MATMUL_WARP_M) * cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);

  parallel block_id by NUM_SMS : block {
    shared f16 [MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K] lhs_load_s;
    shared f16 [MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K] rhs_load_s;
    shared f16 [MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N] output_s;

    foreach {tile_iter} in [cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)] {
      tile_id = tile_iter # block_id;
      if (tile_id < total_tiles) {
        block_m = tile_id / cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);
        block_n = tile_id % cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);

        mc = mma.fill.f16 0.0f;
        foreach {iv_k} in [cdiv(K, MATMUL_TILE_K)] {
          tma.copy.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> lhs.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).step(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(block_m, iv_k) => lhs_load_s;
          tma.copy.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> rhs.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K).step(MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(block_n, iv_k) => rhs_load_s;
          foreach {iv_warp} in [cdiv(MATMUL_TILE_K, MATMUL_WARP_K)] {
            parallel p by 1 : group-4 {
              ma = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> lhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp);
              mb = mma.load.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ> rhs_load_s.chunkat(_, iv_warp);
              mma.row.row mc, ma, mb;
            }
          }
        }
        mma.store mc, output_s;
        tma.copy output_s => output.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(block_m, block_n);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Typical constants** in that file (Hopper-class **H800 PCIe** in the benchmark) include:

- **`NUM_SMS = 114`** — persistent launch width chosen to track SM count for that SKU
- **`MATMUL_WARP_M = 64`**, **`MATMUL_WARP_N = 128`**, **`MATMUL_TILE_K = 64`**, **`MATMUL_WARP_K = 16`**, **`MATMUL_SWIZ = 128`**

The **inner** K-loop, TMA + WGMMA structure, and **`parallel ... : group-4`** warpgroup are the same ideas as Chapter 4 and Chapter 5; what is new is the **outer** `parallel block_id by NUM_SMS`, the **`foreach tile_iter`**, the **`#`** composition, **`if`**, **`.step`**, and the arithmetic that maps **`tile_id`** to **`block_m` / `block_n`**.

## Fixed launch and tile striping

Suppose **`M`** and **`N`** are large enough that **`tiles_m * tiles_n`** is **much larger** than the number of SMs on your GPU. With a **data-dependent** grid—one CTA per tile—the hardware schedules tiles in **waves**. After each wave finishes, a new wave starts. In the **last** wave, only **some** SMs have work; the rest sit idle. That **tail** underutilizes the chip.

A **persistent** layout flips the picture: you launch **`NUM_SMS`** blocks (or another fixed count you choose), and **every** block stays busy across **many** logical tiles. Work is **striped** across CTAs so that block **`b`** handles tiles **`b`, `b + NUM_SMS`, `b + 2 * NUM_SMS`, ...**.

You avoid the “almost empty final wave” problem at the **grid** level because you never asked for **`total_tiles`** separate CTAs in the first place. The tradeoff is **software complexity**: you need a loop over tile indices, a mapping from a **linear** tile id back to **`(block_m, block_n)`**, and a guard for **padding** iterations when striping does not divide evenly. Choreo’s `__co__` function makes that explicit and readable.

Earlier matmul chapters used a **two-dimensional** parallel over **`block_m`** and **`block_n`**, with bounds derived from **`M`** and **`N`**. Here you use a **one-dimensional** parallel over **`block_id`**:

```choreo
parallel block_id by NUM_SMS : block {
```

This launches exactly **`NUM_SMS`** thread blocks. The index **`block_id`** runs from **`0`** to **`NUM_SMS - 1`**. It is **not** tied to a single output tile anymore; it names **which** persistent worker you are in the pool.

Contrast that with:

```choreo
parallel {block_m, block_n} by [cdiv(M, MATMUL_WARP_M), cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N)] : block {
```

In the data-dependent version, **grid size grows with problem size**. In the persistent version, **grid size is fixed** (here, **`NUM_SMS`**), and **problem size** shows up in **`total_tiles`** and the **inner** loop count instead.

You treat the **`tiles_m × tiles_n`** output grid as a single sequence of **`total_tiles`** tiles, numbered **`0 .. total_tiles - 1`** in **row-major** order over **`(block_m, block_n)`**:

```choreo
int total_tiles = cdiv(M, MATMUL_WARP_M) * cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);
```

So **`tile_id = 0`** corresponds to **`(block_m, block_n) = (0, 0)`**, then **`(0, 1)`**, …, then **`(1, 0)`**, and so on—exactly the order implied by:

```choreo
block_m = tile_id / cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);
block_n = tile_id % cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N);
```

Here **`cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N)`** is the number of tiles along **N**; dividing by it recovers the row index **`block_m`**, and the remainder is the column index **`block_n`**. This is ordinary integer **Choreo** arithmetic: it tells TMA and the output store **which** logical output tile this iteration is responsible for.

Each persistent CTA does not own a contiguous chunk of that sequence. CTA **`b`** processes **`tile_id`** values **`b`, b + NUM_SMS, b + 2 * NUM_SMS, ...`**—a **stride-`NUM_SMS`** walk through the linearized list. That is how **`NUM_SMS`** workers share the load evenly in the steady state.

## `tile_iter`, `block_id`, and the `#` operator

The loop:

```choreo
foreach {tile_iter} in [cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)] {
  tile_id = tile_iter # block_id;
```

does two things at once.

**`tile_iter`** counts **which pass** this CTA is on: **`0`**, **`1`**, …, up to **`cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS) - 1`**. The upper bound uses **`cdiv`** (ceiling division) so that if **`total_tiles`** is not a multiple of **`NUM_SMS`**, you still iterate enough times for the **last** few tiles to be reached by **some** block.

You might first guess **`total_tiles / NUM_SMS`** passes per block; that only works when **`total_tiles`** divides evenly by **`NUM_SMS`**. In general, **some** blocks must run **one more** pass than others so that **all** tiles **`0 .. total_tiles - 1`** appear exactly once. **`cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)`** is the **maximum**, over all blocks, of how many **`tile_iter`** steps each block needs. Blocks that would otherwise finish early still run the extra iterations; those iterations hit **`tile_id >= total_tiles`** and **skip** the **`if`** body. That is cheap compared to launching **`total_tiles`** separate CTAs or trying to use divergent grid sizes per block—CUDA does not offer that at launch granularity anyway.

Second, **`tile_id = tile_iter # block_id`** **composes** the pass index with the **block index** to form the **global linear tile id** for this iteration. Read **`#`** as “combine **`tile_iter`** and **`block_id`** into the **`tile_id`** this striping scheme assigns to this block at this step.” For block **`block_id`**, iteration **`tile_iter`** handles the tile at position **`tile_iter * NUM_SMS + block_id`** in the linear ordering—matching the stride-**`NUM_SMS`** picture above.

If you are coming from CUDA C, this is the same algebra you would write by hand; Choreo makes the **iteration space** and **composition** part of the `__co__` language.

## The `if` guard and `.step` on `subspan`

Because **`foreach {tile_iter} in [cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)]`** may run **one extra** iteration for some blocks when **`total_tiles`** is not divisible by **`NUM_SMS`**, some pairs **`(tile_iter, block_id)`** yield **`tile_id >= total_tiles`**. The guard:

```choreo
if (tile_id < total_tiles) {
  ...
}
```

skips **all** TMA, MMA, and store work for those **padding** iterations. **Shared** buffers stay **declared** at block scope (outside the **`if`**), but only **valid** tiles execute the body. Without this guard, you would index **`block_m` / `block_n`** and global tensors **out of range** for bogus **`tile_id`** values. This is a central persistent pattern: **round up** the iteration count for simplicity, then **predicate** the real work.

In the listing at the top of the chapter, **`shared`** buffers are declared **once per CTA**, **outside** the **`if`**. That matches CUDA SMEM usage: **one** allocation per thread block, reused for **every** logical tile that block processes. Only **contents** and **global indices** change per iteration. If you add **warp-specialized** producers and consumers (Chapter 6), you still want **persistent** outer loops **outside** role-specific inner regions so **all** warps agree on how many **tile** iterations the block performs—even when only some warps participate in a given stage.

The TMA lines use **`subspan`** with an explicit **`.step`**:

```choreo
lhs.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).step(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(block_m, iv_k)
rhs.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K).step(MATMUL_WARP_N, MATMUL_TILE_K).at(block_n, iv_k)
```

Conceptually, **`subspan`** picks a **tile shape**, and **`.at(block_m, iv_k)`** (or **`block_n`**) anchors that tile in the **global** matrix. **`.step`** states the **stride** between successive tiles along those dimensions when the stride might differ from the visible tile size or when you want the layout spelled out for the compiler and reader.

Earlier chapters often used **`subspan`** **without** **`.step`**, relying on the **default** that stride matches the tile extent. Here **`.step(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_TILE_K)`** matches the **M × K** tile shape for LHS (and similarly for RHS along **N × K**). For this symmetric case the numeric stride equals the subspan size, but **`.step`** makes the intent obvious: “this is the hop between adjacent tiles in index space,” which matters when you vary layouts or read kernels with non-default strides.

The **store** path still uses **`output.subspan(MATMUL_WARP_M, MATMUL_WARP_N).at(block_m, block_n)`** without an explicit **`.step`** in the snippet—consistent with Chapter 4 when the default is clear.

The persistent matmul uses **equal** step and tile size along each axis—the common case for **dense** GEMM tiles that abut without gaps. Other kernels use **`.step`** for **non-contiguous** tiling: for example, a subspan might cover **64** elements along K while the **next** tile starts **128** elements away because of **padding**, **interleaving**, or **blocked storage**. Treat **`.step`** as part of the **view** you hand to TMA: it tells the copy **how indices advance** when you move **`iv_k`** or **`block_m`** by one in the logical loop, not only how big one tile is.

## The inner loop in context

Inside the **`if`**, the body is intentionally familiar:

1. **`mma.fill.f16`** seeds the accumulator **`mc`**.
2. **`foreach iv_k`** stages **`MATMUL_TILE_K`**-wide K-panels from **`lhs`** and **`rhs`** into **`lhs_load_s`** and **`rhs_load_s`** with **`tma.copy.swiz<MATMUL_SWIZ>`**.
3. **`foreach iv_warp`** with **`parallel ... : group-4`** runs **WGMMA** (`mma.load.swiz`, **`mma.row.row`**) over **`MATMUL_WARP_K`** chunks along K.
4. **`mma.store`** then **`tma.copy`** commits **`output_s`** to **`output`** at **`(block_m, block_n)`**.

The **only** structural difference from the one-tile-per-CTA kernel is the **wrapper**: fixed **`parallel block_id`**, **`foreach tile_iter`**, **`tile_id = tile_iter # block_id`**, **`if (tile_id < total_tiles)`**, and the **linear-to-2D** mapping. The **tensor-core pipeline** itself is unchanged.

| Aspect | One CTA per tile (Chapter 4 style) | Persistent (`NUM_SMS` CTAs) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Launch count | **`cdiv(M, …) * cdiv(N, …)`** — grows with problem size | **Fixed** — e.g. **`NUM_SMS`** |
| Which tile a block does | **`(block_m, block_n)`** from the parallel indices | **`(block_m, block_n)`** from **`tile_id`** after striping |
| Tail SM utilization | Last grid wave may leave SMs idle | CTAs keep pulling tiles until none remain |
| Extra Choreo constructs | Minimal | **`total_tiles`**, **`foreach tile_iter`**, **`#`**, **`if`** |

Neither style changes **correctness** of the multiply; both should match a reference GEMM modulo floating-point associativity. The persistent form is an **occupancy and scheduling** choice, especially attractive when **`total_tiles >> NUM_SMS`**.

The table is a compact recap: same tensor-core work, different **wrapper** and **launch** story.

## Tile scheduling variants and `NUM_SMS`

The benchmark directory also ships **persistent** matmuls that change **how** linear **`tile_id`** maps to **`(block_m, block_n)`**—or how tiles are **ordered** in memory and time—for example:

- **`matmul_f16_dyn_persis_colmajor_sm90.co`** — column-major (or otherwise reordered) traversal
- **`matmul_f16_dyn_persis_swizzle_sm90.co`** — **swizzle**-style reordering of tile ids for locality or load balance
- **`matmul_f16_dyn_persis_hilbert_sm90.co`** — **Hilbert curve**–style space-filling traversal

The **launch** and **`if`-guard** ideas stay the same; what changes is the **formula** that turns **`tile_id`** into **`block_m`** and **`block_n`** (and sometimes the goal—e.g., spreading traffic across DRAM channels or reducing L2 thrash). When you read those files, compare their **`tile_id`** mapping to the simple row-major **`/`** and **`%`** shown here.

SM86 variants of the same names (e.g. **`matmul_f16_dyn_persis_colmajor_sm86.co`**) adapt the **same scheduling ideas** to an earlier architecture’s tensor and copy instructions; the **persistent loop skeleton** remains the right mental model.

The benchmark pins **`NUM_SMS`** to **114** for **H800 PCIe** to match that SKU’s **SM count**. In your own port, you might set **`NUM_SMS`** from a **runtime** driver query or a **compile-time** constant for a **family** of GPUs.

The persistent pattern still works if you launch **fewer** CTAs than SMs—some SMs stay idle—or **more** CTAs than SMs (multiple blocks per SM over time), though the sweet spot is usually **close to** the hardware SM count so you **fill** the machine without gratuitous oversubscription.

**`total_tiles`** already accounts for **partial** tiles at the **bottom** and **right** of **`M × N`** because **`cdiv(M, MATMUL_WARP_M)`** and **`cdiv(N, MATMUL_WARP_N)`** count tiles the same way the data-dependent grid did. TMA and the store still target **`MATMUL_WARP_M × MATMUL_WARP_N`** logical tiles; **`M`**, **`N`**, **`K`** stay **symbolic** in the Choreo function, and generated code must respect **tail** elements as in the non-persistent kernel.

The **persistent** layer does not change **edge** behavior—it only changes **how many** CTAs iterate **which** **`(block_m, block_n)`** pairs.

If you already have a **working** tile-per-CTA Hopper matmul, you can migrate it mechanically. Keep a reference build so you can regression-test numerically; mistakes in **`#`** or the guard often surface as wrong answers or out-of-bounds stores.

1. **Compute** **`total_tiles`** from **`M`**, **`N`**, and your output tile sizes (same **`cdiv`** products you used for grid extents).
2. **Replace** **`parallel {block_m, block_n} by [...]`** with **`parallel block_id by NUM_SMS`** (tune **`NUM_SMS`** to your target GPU).
3. **Wrap** the former body in **`foreach {tile_iter} in [cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)]`**, set **`tile_id = tile_iter # block_id`**, and add **`if (tile_id < total_tiles)`**.
4. **Derive** **`block_m`** and **`block_n`** from **`tile_id`** with **`/`** and **`%`** (or swap in a **swizzle / Hilbert** mapping from the other benchmarks).
5. **Keep** **`shared`** declarations at **block** scope; **reuse** SMEM across tile iterations.
6. **Optional:** add **`.step(...)`** on **`subspan`** TMA sources if you want strides explicit or non-default.

**Pitfall:** wrong **`#`** scheduling, loop bounds, or guards produce kernels that are **almost** right—duplicate or skipped **`tile_id`** values, or writes past **`output`**. Re-run numerical checks as for any refactor.

If something is off, verify **`total_tiles`**, **`cdiv(total_tiles, NUM_SMS)`**, and—for one block—the sequence of **`tile_id`** over **`tile_iter`**. Duplicates or gaps mean the schedule or bound is wrong. Unguarded invalid ids show up as faults or garbage outside the true output region.

Persistent matmul kernels launch a **fixed** pool of CTAs—**`parallel block_id by NUM_SMS : block`**—and **loop** over logical output tiles with **`total_tiles`**, **`tile_iter # block_id`**, and **`if (tile_id < total_tiles)`** for padding. **`.step(...)`** on **`subspan`** documents (and can generalize) stride between tiles. Inside the guard, the **TMA + WGMMA + store** path matches the non-persistent Hopper matmul from earlier chapters.

Chapter 8 widens the story to **multiple warpgroups** and **multiple accumulators** so a single output tile can use more SM throughput. You will build on the same TMA and WGMMA core, now that you know how to **schedule** it across the machine with persistent CTAs.
