# Croqtile Tutorial

Welcome to the Croqtile tutorial. This guide walks you through writing high-performance GPU kernels using Croqtile, starting from scratch and building up to production-grade patterns.

Each chapter introduces a small set of new concepts by evolving a running example. By the end, you will have encountered every major Croqtile construct in a concrete, working program. For detailed syntax design and language reference, see the [Coding Reference](../documentation/index.md).
