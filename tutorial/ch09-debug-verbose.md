# Debug and Verbose: Printing, RTTI, and GDB

So far you have walked the full Croktile stack: from **element-wise addition** (Chapter 1) through **data movement** with `dma.copy` and tiles (Chapter 2), **parallelism** across blocks and threads (Chapter 3), **tensor cores** and `mma` (Chapter 4), **warp specialization** (Chapter 5), **pipelined execution** with producer–consumer roles (Chapter 6), **TMA** and irregular access (Chapter 7), and **C++ escape hatches** (Chapter 8). Each step added performance — and complexity.

Your kernel compiles and launches without errors, but the results are wrong. On a CPU you might set a breakpoint on a single iteration and step forward with confidence. On a GPU that mental model breaks: **thousands of threads**, **nondeterministic interleaving** of `printf` output, and **no practical way to stop “this warp, this iteration”** the way you would in a scalar loop. Croktile does not remove those constraints, but it gives you **compile-time shape printing**, **guarded device `println`**, **debug RTTI for `cuda-gdb`**, and a clear **order of suspicion** so debugging stays tractable.

This chapter follows one storyline — **debugging Croktile kernels** — from compile-time inspection to runtime `printf`, through MMA-specific pitfalls, to stepping in GDB.

## `print!` and `println!`: compile-time inspection

The bang variants (`print!`, `println!`) run at **compile time**, not at runtime. They print to the compiler’s output and are useful for inspecting shapes, extents, and type information **without launching a kernel**:

```choreo
__co__ void check_shapes(f32 [3, 2] b) {
  print!("shape of b: ");
  println!("b.span = ", b.span);
}
```

When you compile this file, the compiler emits:

```
shape of b: b.span = {3, 2}
```

No GPU needed. String literals are concatenated (`"wor" "ld!"` becomes `"world!"`), which is handy for building diagnostic messages from fragments. Use `print!` / `println!` to verify that `chunkat` and `subspan` produce the tile sizes you expect before you spend time on a full kernel launch.

## `print` and `println`: runtime device output

**Runtime printing.** `print` writes its arguments to standard output; `println` does the same but appends a newline. Both work inside `__co__` functions and emit device-side `printf` calls in the generated CUDA:

```choreo
__co__ void inspect(s32 [4, 8] data) {
  foreach i in [data.span] {
    println("element ", i, " = ", data.at(i));
  }
}
```

Each `println` call takes a comma-separated mix of string literals and expressions. Strings are printed verbatim; expressions are evaluated and printed as their runtime value. The output order across threads is **nondeterministic** — GPU `printf` buffers are flushed asynchronously, so lines from different threads interleave unpredictably.

**Guarding output.** For a specific check — say, whether tile index `(3, 5)` computes the right partial sum — guard the print with a condition:

```choreo
parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] : block
  parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] : thread {
    // ... compute ...
    if (px == 0 && py == 0 && qx == 3 && qy == 5) {
      println("partial sum = ", accum);
    }
  }
```

Without the guard you get one line per thread — thousands of lines for a large grid, most of which you do not care about.

## Debugging MMA-heavy kernels

When the wrong answer comes from a **tensor-core path**, treat it as its own category. **Suspect layout first** — row versus column major, and whether the RHS is logically `[N, K]` versus `[K, N]` in memory — **then indexing** (which `block_m`, `block_n`, and K slice you attached with `.at` / `chunkat`), **then async ordering** if you introduced asynchronous copies or split producer and consumer warps. A common mistake is **mislabeling `mma.row.row`** when the staged data is actually column-major, or using **`chunkat` indices that do not align** with the MMA tile geometry. If you use swizzled loads (`tma.copy.swiz` / `mma.load.swiz`), a mismatch against plain row expectations shows up as a **regular pattern** in the error (for example every sixteenth element correct, the rest shifted) — the systematic workflow below calls that out explicitly.

## Debug RTTI and `cuda-gdb`

When `print` / `println` is not enough — you need to step through execution, inspect register state, or examine complex data structures — Croktile supports **debug RTTI** (Runtime Type Information) that makes its types visible to `cuda-gdb`.

**Build flags.** Compile with `-g -O0` to enable debug symbols and disable optimizations:

```bash
croktile kernel.co -g -O0 -o kernel_debug
```

The generated code includes RTTI structs for Croktile types:

| Croktile type | GDB type | Fields |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Shaped tensor (`s32 [M, N]`) | `choreo::rtti::spanned<int, 2>` | `.span.data[]` (dimensions), `.stride.data[]` (strides), `.data` (pointer) |
| Index tuple | `choreo::rtti::bounded_ituple<N>` | `.data[]` (values), `.ub[]` (upper bounds) |
| Integer tuple | `choreo::rtti::ituple<N>` | `.data[]` (values) |
| Multi-dim span | `choreo::rtti::mdspan<N>` | `.data[]` (extents) |

**Example session.** A GDB session on a debug-compiled kernel:

```bash
cuda-gdb -q ./kernel_debug
(gdb) break my_kernel
(gdb) run
(gdb) ptype __dbg_lhs
type = struct choreo::rtti::spanned<int, 2>
(gdb) print __dbg_lhs.span.data[0]
$1 = 32
(gdb) print __dbg_lhs.span.data[1]
$2 = 64
(gdb) print __dbg_lhs.data != 0
$3 = true
```

The `__dbg_` prefix on variable names is generated by the compiler — it makes Croktile variables visible to GDB alongside the generated C++ intermediates. You can inspect tensor dimensions, strides, and data pointers, and step through the generated code to see which iteration of a `foreach` loop produces a wrong value.

## Putting it together: a systematic workflow

The following order is deliberate: **cheap compile-time checks first**, then **narrowed runtime prints**, then **pipeline semantics**, **layout**, and finally **the debugger** for pointer-level bugs.

![Debugging workflow: shapes → one tile → sync → layout → GDB](../assets/images/ch09/fig1_debug_workflow_dark.png#only-dark)
![Debugging workflow: shapes → one tile → sync → layout → GDB](../assets/images/ch09/fig1_debug_workflow_light.png#only-light)

**1. Check shapes.** Use `println!` at compile time to verify that all `chunkat`, `subspan`, and `span` expressions produce the tile sizes you expect. Shape bugs are the most common category — a mismatched extent silently reads or writes wrong memory regions.

**2. Check one tile.** Add a guarded `println` inside the K loop that fires only for block `(0, 0)` and one thread. Print the accumulator value after each K iteration. Compare with a hand-computed reference for that specific output element.

**3. Check synchronization.** If the value is wrong only at large K, suspect event ordering. Print `iv_k` and `stage` in both producer and consumer to verify they visit the same sequence. A common bug: the consumer’s `trigger empty[stage]` fires too early, allowing the producer to overwrite a buffer the consumer is still reading.

**4. Check layout.** If the result is wrong in a pattern (e.g., every sixteenth element is correct, the rest are shifted), suspect a row-major vs column-major mismatch in `mma.row.row` or a swizzle mode inconsistency between `tma.copy.swiz<N>` and `mma.load.swiz<N>`. Cross-check with the MMA subsection above.

**5. Use GDB for pointer bugs.** If `println` shows a value that makes no sense (NaN, huge integer, zero when nonzero is expected), compile with `-g -O0` and step through in `cuda-gdb`. Inspect the tensor pointer (`__dbg_x.data`) and check whether it points to valid memory.

**Performance before benchmarks.** `print` / `println` are expensive: each call serializes through a global `printf` buffer and destroys throughput measurements. Debug RTTI structs add register pressure and inhibit optimization. Remove all prints and drop `-g -O0` before benchmarking. A practical compromise is to keep prints behind a `#ifdef DEBUG_PRINT` macro (Chapter 8) so you can toggle them from the command line without editing the source:

```choreo
#ifdef DEBUG_PRINT
  println("tile_k=", iv_k, " accum=", mc);
#endif
```

Compile with `croktile kernel.co -DDEBUG_PRINT` to enable, or without the flag for production runs.

## Summary

| Construct / tool | Role |
|------------------|------|
| `print!` / `println!` | Compile-time shape and type inspection; no kernel launch |
| `print` / `println` | Device-side `printf`; use guards to avoid log floods |
| MMA debugging | Layout → indexing → async ordering; watch `mma.*` vs actual memory order |
| `-g -O0`, `cuda-gdb`, RTTI | Inspect `__dbg_*` tensors, pointers, and control flow |
| `#ifdef DEBUG_PRINT` | Optional printf without permanent overhead |

You started from **element-wise addition** in Chapter 1, learned **data movement** (Chapter 2), **parallelism** (Chapter 3), **tensor cores** (Chapter 4), **warp specialization** (Chapter 5), **pipelines** (Chapter 6), **TMA** (Chapter 7), **C++ interop** (Chapter 8), and **debugging** (Chapter 9). The next productive step is to open a benchmark kernel from the `croktile/benchmark/` directory, map its regions to the chapters here, change one constant, rebuild, and measure. Small, deliberate edits beat large rewrites — the `#error` guards will tell you when a configuration stops being legal long before you chase mysterious wrong answers on the GPU.
