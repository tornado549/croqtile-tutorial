# Data Movement Basics: Moving Data Blocks as a Whole

In Chapter 1, you added two arrays element by element. The tileflow program carved the tensors into chunks, copied each chunk into local memory with `dma.copy`, called a tiny CUDA kernel, and wrote the result back. That pattern is a perfect introduction to Choreo because the arithmetic is trivial: every output element depends only on the matching input elements in the same place.

Matrix multiplication is different. Each output element is a dot product along an entire *inner* dimension, so a naïve kernel touches a lot of global data unless you reorganize how work and memory line up. This chapter uses plain matrix multiply — first without explicit DMA, then with `dma.copy` and tiling — to show how Choreo expresses **element-level indexing**, **tile index composition**, and **nested parallelism**. By the end, you will have a mental model for why GPUs move data in blocks and how Choreo makes that explicit.

## The Scalar Matmul: Parallelism Without DMA

We start with the smallest complete matmul in the Choreo test suite: no DMA, no device kernel call in the tileflow — just `parallel`, `foreach`, and arithmetic on spanned tensors. It is not how you would ship production GEMM, but it is the cleanest place to learn `.at()`, `#`, and `span`.

### Function shape and output allocation

```choreo
__co__ s32 [128, 256] matmul(s32 [128, 256] lhs, s32 [256, 256] rhs) {
  s32[lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output;
  // ...
  return output;
}
```

The signature says the function returns a `128 × 256` matrix of 32-bit integers. The left-hand side `lhs` is `128 × 256`; the right-hand side `rhs` is `256 × 256`, so the classic contraction dimension is the shared `256`.

The line that allocates `output` is worth a slow read. Instead of repeating literal sizes, it ties the output shape to the *actual* extents of the operands:

- `lhs.span(0)` is the size of `lhs` along its first axis — here, `128` (rows of the result).
- `rhs.span(1)` is the size of `rhs` along its second axis — here, `256` (columns of the result).

You will see `lhs.span` without an index when the full shape is implied (as in Chapter 1). The indexed form `span(i)` picks out one dimension when you are building a tensor whose rank does not match the operand's rank, or when you want to be explicit about which axis you mean.

### Parallel over a 2D grid of tiles

```choreo
  parallel p by 16, q by 64 {
```

This declares two **parallel indices** at once: `p` and `q`. Think of them as a logical 2D launch grid. The first axis is split into 16 tiles; the second into 64. Choreo uses the comma form `p by 16, q by 64` when you want a Cartesian product of parallel dimensions without introducing extra braces.

A quick sanity check on the numbers never hurts. With `#p = 16` and `#q = 64`, the `foreach` bounds `128 / #p` and `256 / #q` evaluate to `8` and `4`. So each `(p, q)` tile owns an `8 × 4` block of output elements, and there are `16 × 64 = 1024` such tiles in parallel — enough to cover the full `128 × 256` result without gaps or overlaps, because `16 × 8 = 128` and `64 × 4 = 256`. When you write your own tilings, this kind of multiplication check is how you catch an off-by-one factor in the parallel grid before you ever run the program.

### The triple loop with named indices

```choreo
    foreach index = {m, n, k} in [128 / #p , 256 / #q, 256]
      output.at(m#p, n#q) += lhs.at(m#p, k) * rhs.at(k, n#q);
```

The `foreach` iterates three nested indices, but instead of three separate `in` clauses, it **names a tuple** of indices: `{m, n, k}`. The `index =` part binds that tuple to the loop variable `index` (handy if you later need the whole thing); the important part for reading the body is that `m`, `n`, and `k` are in scope inside the loop.

The trip counts are symbolic fractions of the parallel grid:

- `128 / #p` — how many row steps each `p`-tile owns along the result rows.
- `256 / #q` — how many column steps each `q`-tile owns.
- `256` — the full inner dimension (the contraction length).

Here `#p` and `#q` mean "the **extent** of the parallel index" — the number of tiles along that axis. So `128 / #p` is exactly the height of one tile in rows, and `256 / #q` is the width of one tile in columns. The inner `k` runs over the whole `K` dimension; this version does not yet break `K` into chunks in memory.

### `.at()` and the `#` composition operator

Until now, you mostly saw whole chunks (`lhs.chunkat(...)`) and device kernels that consumed flat pointers. For matmul we need **element-level** addressing on spanned values. That is what `.at(...)` is for: it takes one index per dimension and refers to a single scalar inside the tensor view.

The interesting indices are the ones that mix **intra-tile** offsets with **which tile** you are in:

- `m#p` — row index in the full matrix: offset `m` within tile column `p`.
- `n#q` — column index: offset `n` within tile column `q`.

Read `#` as **compose**: "local offset within tile" glued to "parallel tile id." So `m` runs from `0` up to (but not including) the per-tile row count, and `p` selects which horizontal band of rows you are responsible for; `m#p` is the global row. Likewise `n#q` is the global column.

The multiply-accumulate is the textbook formula:

\[
C_{ij} \mathrel{+}= \sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj}
\]

In Choreo, for a fixed `(m, n, k)` inside tile `(p, q)`:

- `lhs.at(m#p, k)` takes row `m#p` and column `k` from the left matrix.
- `rhs.at(k, n#q)` takes row `k` and column `n#q` from the right matrix.
- `output.at(m#p, n#q)` accumulates into the result cell at that global row and column.

No temporary buffers, no `dma.copy` — the compiler still has to implement loads and stores under the hood, but the **tileflow** you wrote is entirely in terms of global tensor indices.

### Host side: owning buffers with `make_spandata`

Chapter 1 used `choreo::make_spanview` to wrap existing C arrays. For tests that do not need a preallocated stack array, Choreo can allocate for you:

```choreo
int main() {
  auto lhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(128, 256);
  auto rhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(256, 256);
  lhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = matmul(lhs.view(), rhs.view());
  // verification...
  std::cout << "Test Passed\n" << std::endl;
}
```

`make_spandata` builds a **dense owning buffer** with the given shape. It is the host-side counterpart to the `spanned_data` return type from Chapter 1: you can fill it, query `.shape()`, and pass a non-owning `view()` into a `__co__` function so the tileflow sees a normal spanned input.

The verification loop is ordinary C++: compare `res` against a reference triple loop over `lhs` and `rhs`. The point of this chapter is the tileflow; the host code stays boring on purpose.

### What this version teaches — and what it omits

You have now seen:

- Multi-dimensional `parallel` with comma-separated axes.
- `foreach` with **named destructuring** `index = {m, n, k}` and a single `in [..., ..., ...]` shape.
- `.at` for scalar indexing into spanned tensors.
- `#` for combining loop indices with parallel tile ids.
- `span(0)` / `span(1)` for extracting individual dimension sizes into a new tensor's shape.
- `make_spandata` for owned host tensors and `.view()` to borrow them into a kernel.

What you have *not* seen yet is any control over **where** those `lhs.at` / `rhs.at` reads land in the memory hierarchy. For large matrices on real hardware, reading every `k` step from far-away global memory inside the innermost loop is exactly what you want to fix next. That is where DMA and explicit local buffers enter the story.

### Complete scalar matmul (tileflow + host)

For reference, here is the full scalar program as it appears in the Choreo tests (minus the `// REQUIRES` / `// RUN` harness lines). Read it top to bottom once: the tileflow fits on a handful of lines, and the host is almost entirely verification.

```choreo
__co__ s32 [128, 256] matmul(s32 [128, 256] lhs, s32 [256, 256] rhs) {
  s32[lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output;

  parallel p by 16, q by 64 {
    foreach index = {m, n, k} in [128 / #p , 256 / #q, 256]
      output.at(m#p, n#q) += lhs.at(m#p, k) * rhs.at(k, n#q);
  }
  return output;
}

int main() {
  auto lhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(128, 256);
  auto rhs = choreo::make_spandata<choreo::s32>(256, 256);
  lhs.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = matmul(lhs.view(), rhs.view());

  for (size_t i = 0; i < res.shape()[0]; ++i)
    for (size_t j = 0; j < res.shape()[1]; ++j) {
      int ref = 0;
      for (size_t k = 0; k < lhs.shape()[1]; ++k)
        ref += lhs[i][k] * rhs[k][j];
      choreo::choreo_assert(ref == res[i][j], "values are not equal.");
    }

  std::cout << "Test Passed\n" << std::endl;
}
```

Notice the symmetry between the tileflow and the reference: the triple `foreach` is the same `i, j, k` contraction as the host's `ref` loop, only written in terms of tiles and composed indices. That is a useful pattern when you are debugging — if the host reference passes and the tileflow fails, you can usually narrow the bug to indexing (`#`, `.at`, or trip counts) rather than to the arithmetic itself.

### Tracing a single output cell

Pick a concrete output position, say global row `37` and column `50`. In the scalar program, there is exactly one pair `(p, q)` and one pair `(m, n)` such that `m#p = 37` and `n#q = 50`. Because rows are split across `16` tiles of height `8`, tile `p = 37 / 8 = 4` and within-tile offset `m = 37 % 8 = 5`. Similarly `50 / 4 = 12` so `q = 12`, and `n = 50 % 4 = 2`. For that fixed `(p, q, m, n)`, the loop over `k` runs from `0` to `255`, and each iteration adds one product to the same `output.at(37, 50)`. Nothing in this version says *how* the hardware should cache those loads — it only states the dependence chain. The DMA version below will make the *reuse* of `lhs` and `rhs` values across `k` explicit by loading contiguous K-slabs into `local` first.

## The DMA Matmul: Blocks Along K

The file `matmul-dma.co` keeps the same mathematical contract — `128 × 256` times `256 × 256` → `128 × 256` — but changes the **orchestration**. Instead of indexing global `lhs` and `rhs` for every `(k, qx, qy)`, it loads **rectangular tiles** of `lhs` and `rhs` into local memory once per `tile_k`, then performs the arithmetic against those local views.

### Why move data in blocks?

GPUs hide memory latency by keeping many threads busy and by exploiting fast **on-chip** storage (shared memory, registers, L2). If each multiply goes straight to device DRAM, you spend most of your time waiting on loads. A standard pattern is:

1. Cooperatively load a **tile** of `A` and a **tile** of `B` that are relevant to the same slice of `K`.
2. Compute partial dot products from those tiles while they are still hot in fast memory.
3. Advance `tile_k` and repeat until the full inner dimension is covered.

Choreo makes step 1 explicit with `dma.copy ... => local`. You still write the arithmetic with `.at`, but the tensors you read in the inner loop are the **loaded** locals, not the global spanned parameters.

### Top-level parallel grid over output tiles

```choreo
  parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] {
```

This is the **brace form** for multi-dimensional parallelism: one parallel index tuple `{px, py}` with a matching tile count vector `[8, 16]`. The grid is `8 × 16` tiles. Together with the inner `parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16]`, the example carves the `128 × 256` output into a hierarchy: coarse tiles `(px, py)` and finer sub-tiles `(qx, qy)` inside each coarse tile.

If you are used to CUDA `blockIdx` / `threadIdx`, think of `px, py` as a logical block over the output matrix and `qx, qy` as a finer partition inside that block — Choreo keeps the algebra of indices explicit instead of folding everything into one flat thread id.

### Outer `foreach` over K-tiles

```choreo
    foreach {tile_k} in [16] {
      lhs_load = dma.copy lhs.chunkat(px, tile_k) => local;
      rhs_load = dma.copy rhs.chunkat(tile_k , py) => local;
```

There are `16` steps along the `tile_k` axis (the test's chosen factorization). For each step:

- `lhs.chunkat(px, tile_k)` selects the **rows** owned by `px` and the **K-range** owned by `tile_k`. Intuitively, it is the strip of `lhs` that participates in this K-tile for those output rows.
- `rhs.chunkat(tile_k, py)` selects the **K-range** for `tile_k` and the **columns** owned by `py` — the strip of `rhs` that lines up with the same contraction chunk.

Both copies target `local`, i.e. fast memory visible to the compute that will consume them. The assignments `lhs_load =` and `rhs_load =` bind **futures** (the DMA operations in flight). The next section shows how the inner compute waits on those implicitly and reads through `.data`.

Spacing in `chunkat(tile_k , py)` is only stylistic; Choreo ignores the extra space.

### Nested `parallel` and the inner `k` loop

```choreo
      parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] {
        foreach k in [256 / #tile_k] {
          output.at(px#qx, py#qy) += lhs_load.data.at(qx, k) * rhs_load.data.at(k, qy);
        }
      }
```

A second `parallel` nest subdivides each `(px, py)` tile. Indices `qx` and `qy` are composed with `px` and `py` exactly like `m#p` in the scalar version: `px#qx` is the global output row; `py#qy` is the global output column.

Inside, `k` runs over the **K extent of this loaded tile**. The trip count is `256 / #tile_k`: total inner size divided by the number of `tile_k` steps. Each `tile_k` iteration loads another slab of `K`; within that slab, `k` indexes the position inside the slab.

Crucially, the loads use **`lhs_load.data` and `rhs_load.data`**. The `dma.copy` future's `.data` member is the local spanned buffer you can index with `.at`. The global `lhs` / `rhs` parameters are not touched in the innermost statement — the hardware (via generated code) already brought the relevant rectangles into `local`.

Nested `parallel` expresses **two levels of parallelism**: orchestration across the output grid, and finer-grained work inside each tile. On a GPU target, the compiler maps these to warps, blocks, and shared memory in ways that depend on the backend; the tileflow you write stays at the level of *what* is parallel, not *which* hardware register holds which tid.

### Dimension arithmetic for the DMA nest

It helps to read the DMA example as a stack of factors. The output has shape `128 × 256`. The outer parallel grid is `[8, 16]` along `(px, py)`, so each coarse tile spans `128 / 8 = 16` rows and `256 / 16 = 16` columns of the result. The inner parallel grid is `[16, 16]` along `(qx, qy)`, which subdivides that `16 × 16` block into `16 × 16` sub-cells of size `1 × 1`. In other words, at this particular choice of numbers, each inner `(qx, qy)` pair is responsible for exactly one output element inside the coarse `(px, py)` tile — a common didactic layout because you can read `px#qx` and `py#qy` as "row and column in the global matrix" without an extra scaling factor in your head.

Along `K`, the outer `foreach {tile_k} in [16]` fixes `#tile_k = 16`, so each DMA slice covers `256 / 16 = 16` consecutive `k` values. The inner `foreach k in [256 / #tile_k]` therefore runs `k = 0 … 15` inside each loaded tile. For each `tile_k`, the `chunkat` expressions pull the matching `lhs` rows for `px` and `rhs` columns for `py` — aligned strips so that `lhs_load.data.at(qx, k) * rhs_load.data.at(k, qy)` is a legal multiply for every `k` in that slab. After all `tile_k` iterations complete, every output has seen contributions from the full `256`-long contraction, just as in the scalar program.

You do not have to memorize these exact factors. What you should internalize is the **pattern**: outer parallelism over output regions, an outer sequential or tiled loop over `K` that triggers DMA, inner parallelism over the fine structure of the tile, and an inner `k` loop whose length is the **current K-tile height**, not the full `256` every time.

### Complete DMA matmul (tileflow + host)

Here is the full `matmul-dma.co` body for side-by-side comparison with the scalar version. The tileflow is longer, but the `main` function is still mostly setup and verification.

```choreo
__co__ s32 [128, 256] matmul(s32 [128, 256] lhs, s32 [256, 256] rhs) {
  s32[lhs.span(0), rhs.span(1)] output;
  parallel {px, py} by [8, 16] {
    foreach {tile_k} in [16] {
      lhs_load = dma.copy lhs.chunkat(px, tile_k) => local;
      rhs_load = dma.copy rhs.chunkat(tile_k , py) => local;
      parallel {qx, qy} by [16, 16] {
        foreach k in [256 / #tile_k] {
          output.at(px#qx, py#qy) += lhs_load.data.at(qx, k) * rhs_load.data.at(k, qy);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return output;
}

int main() {
  choreo::s32 a[128][256] = {0};
  choreo::s32 b[256][256] = {0};
  auto lhs_data = choreo::make_spanview<2, choreo::s32>((int*)a, {128, 256});
  auto rhs_data = choreo::make_spanview<2, choreo::s32>((int*)b, {256, 256});
  lhs_data.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs_data.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = matmul(lhs_data, rhs_data);

  for (size_t i = 0; i < res.shape()[0]; ++i)
    for (size_t j = 0; j < res.shape()[1]; ++j) {
      int ref = 0;
      for (size_t k = 0; k < lhs_data.shape()[1]; ++k)
        ref += a[i][k] * b[k][j];
      choreo::choreo_assert(ref == res[i][j], "values are not equal.");
    }

  std::cout << "Test Passed\n" << std::endl;
}
```

Comparing the two `__co__` functions line by line is instructive. Both allocate `output` the same way. Both ultimately implement `+= lhs * rhs` into `output.at(...)`. The scalar version states *which global elements* participate in each product; the DMA version states *which tiles were copied* before the product, then uses `.data` to read the copy. That is the whole conceptual step from Chapter 1's "copy a chunk, call a kernel" to "copy a chunk, stay in tileflow and index the chunk."

### Host program: views into stack arrays

The DMA variant's `main` in the test suite uses `make_spanview` with stack-backed storage:

```choreo
int main() {
  choreo::s32 a[128][256] = {0};
  choreo::s32 b[256][256] = {0};
  auto lhs_data = choreo::make_spanview<2, choreo::s32>((int*)a, {128, 256});
  auto rhs_data = choreo::make_spanview<2, choreo::s32>((int*)b, {256, 256});
  lhs_data.fill_random(-10, 10);
  rhs_data.fill_random(-10, 10);

  auto res = matmul(lhs_data, rhs_data);
  // verification against a and b...
}
```

That is the same pattern as Chapter 1: you own the memory (`a`, `b`), and the spanview tells Choreo the rank (`2`) and element type. You could equally allocate with `make_spandata` and pass `.view()` — the tileflow only cares that the arguments are spanned tensors with consistent shapes.

### Scalar vs DMA: same math, different movement story

Both programs implement the same multiply-accumulate. The scalar version is a **reference choreography**: easy to read, direct `.at` on globals. The DMA version is a **movement-aware** choreography: it states *which rectangles* of `lhs` and `rhs` live in `local` for each `tile_k`, and it nests parallelism so that sub-tiles `(qx, qy)` cooperate under each `(px, py)`.

When you optimize further (pipelines, TMA, tensor cores), you will keep this structure: outer loops over tiles and memory stages, inner loops over compute, explicit `.data` views after copies. Chapter 1 gave you DMA around a device kernel; this chapter shows DMA feeding **inline** tileflow arithmetic — same primitives, richer loop nest.

### How this extends Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, `dma.copy` always fed a `__device__` kernel through raw pointers (`lhs_load.data`, `rhs_load.data`, `l1_out`). The matmul DMA example skips the kernel call and uses the same `.data` handles directly in tileflow expressions. Nothing magic changed about DMA — you still get a future, you still read the payload through `.data` — only the *consumer* of that payload is different.

Similarly, Chapter 1 introduced `chunkat` on 3D tensors for element-wise add. Here, `chunkat` takes **two** indices because each operand is a matrix and the tiling axes are the output row tile, the output column tile, and the `K` tile. The rule of thumb is that `chunkat` always lists indices in the same order as the dimensions you are carving; the meaning of each slot follows from the shape of the tensor in the signature.

If you are tempted to merge the scalar and DMA styles — for example, using `.at` on globals for some loops and `.data.at` for others in one kernel — Choreo will let you express that, but readability usually suffers. Pick one level of abstraction per loop nest: either trust the compiler for global accesses, or stage explicitly with `dma.copy` and stay on `.data` until you leave the tile.

## New Syntax and Concepts (Chapter 2 Checklist)

Here is a compact recap of what this chapter added relative to Chapter 1:

| Topic | What to remember |
|--------|------------------|
| `.at(i, j, ...)` | Element-level indexing on spanned tensors; one argument per dimension. |
| `m#p`, `py#qy` | `#` composes an offset within a tile with a parallel tile index to form a global index. |
| `lhs.span(0)`, `rhs.span(1)` | Read individual dimension sizes from an operand's shape when building another tensor. |
| `parallel p by A, q by B` | Comma-separated parallel axes (Cartesian product). |
| `parallel {px, py} by [8, 16]` | Tuple parallel indices with a matching list of tile counts. |
| Nested `parallel` | Outer grid over coarse tiles, inner grid over sub-tiles — hierarchy of parallelism. |
| `dma.copy x.chunkat(...) => local` | Explicit bulk move of a tensor tile into local memory. |
| `future.data.at(...)` | After `dma.copy`, use `.data` to get the local spanned buffer for `.at` indexing. |
| `make_spandata<T>(...)` | Host-side owning buffer; use `.view()` to pass into `__co__` functions. |
| `foreach index = {m, n, k} in [a, b, c]` | Named destructuring: multiple loop indices introduced in one `foreach` head. |
| `128 / #p`, `256 / #tile_k` | `#name` as the extent of parallel index or tile axis in symbolic trip counts. |

If you are comparing to CUDA tutorials, the scalar program is like writing the arithmetic in one place with global pointers; the DMA program is like bringing shared-memory tiles into scope before the inner loops. Choreo's advantage is that both levels are **one language** — the same `.at` notation, the same `parallel` / `foreach` vocabulary — so you can refactor from one to the other without rewriting your host code or inventing ad-hoc macros.

## What's Next

You can now express matrix multiply with explicit tile loads and nested parallelism. The next chapter builds on this by **overlapping** DMA with compute — multiple buffers, pipelined `tile_k` steps, and the habit of thinking in terms of what is in flight while arithmetic runs. Bring the mental model from this chapter: global tensors, `chunkat`, `dma.copy => local`, and `.data` for the pieces you actually compute on.
